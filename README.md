# Voting-simulation-program
Hello!
This program is a voting simulation program that has specific candidates.
In this program, your national code is taken, and if it is in letters, it gives an error and asks the question again, but if it is in numbers, it asks for your vote, and if you enter the name of an existing candidate, one vote is added to it, and if the name of the candidate is Enter missing or ... one vote will be added to the invalid vote. 
To end the voting, enter the country code or exit vote in the section and then the voting is finished and the number of votes for each candidate and invalid votes as well as the country code of the voters are shown.
This program has been fixed with try and except.
I hope you enjoy!
